# An Introduction:
Deploying AI today became a major factor or rule in asserting business everywhere; it proved its ability to look for the main keys in such an enterprise by checking its operational cost, endurance and client satisfaction. 


In this capstone project I decided to compare partially two cities for two countries, which they considered as financial capitals in North America Continent.

So people who live in one of those cities this project will help them to know partially what are the most common venues and its categories between their neighborhoods and get to know what is the highest venue categories and top venues chains. As a futuristic direction, our project can be evolved to give service for a customer willing to establish a venue, where to be found and recommending categories.

Hint: The code exists in the master branch and includes folium visualized maps which can not be viewed on GitHub, therefore move to Week 2 Capstone project and you'll find a link to the notebook on watson studio so, you will able there to view the interactive maps and graphs.

Thank you
